# Open source

We're so excited to announce that Chirpy has been open-sourced now. ðŸš€

## TL;DR

Chirpy is a **privacy-friendly** and **customizable** [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) alternate. With Chirpy, you can reach your audience quickly and build a better community. Check out [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy) to learn how it works.

## Motivation

You may wonder why we build a Disqus alternate in 2022. Well, here are the answers:

[Disqus shared the personal data of tens of millions of users without them or the websites knowing about it.](https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777) ðŸ˜¡

And [Disqus facing $3M fine in Norway for tracking users without consent](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/disqus-facing-3m-fine-in-norway-for-tracking-users-without-consent/)

Disqus also encumbers your website's **performance**: [Disqus makes 76 HTTP Requests per load.](https://supunkavinda.blog/disqus) ðŸ˜±

You can find a ton of [privacy](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=disqus+privacy&oq=disqus+privacy) and [performance](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=disqus+performance) related issues of Disqus if you google it.

## Solution

### Privacy

To avoid such privacy issues, we chose our business model with privacy-friendly in mind. First, we'll be honest: money is necessary for keeping the project development going. A price is always exacted for what free services bestow. You see Ads or you lose privacy. We choose a transparent pricing model â€” You pay, and you get the service. Nothing more.

We also chose our tech stacks carefully, and we prefer to use self-hosted versions of third-party services. For example, for analytics, we self-hosted a [plausible](https://plausible.io/) instance to avoid sharing your customer's data with third-party companies. Plausible is an [open-source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) and [privacy-friendly](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) software as well, we have the same privacy goal.

### Performance

For performance issues, we built our services with modern frontend technologies, e.g. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). We generate comment pages during the building process, so your users will see the UI immediately instead of loading a bunch of JavaScript & CSS and API calls to render the UI. The performance boost is even more noticeable on slow mobile devices.

## Current state

Currently, we're in the public beta phase, so basic features should work:

- Social login
- Create a new project
- Integrate into your existing website
- [Customize the widget styles](http://chirpy.dev/docs/features/theme)
- Comment with Rich Text Formatting and [markdown shortcuts](http://chirpy.dev/docs/features/markdown)
- Like a comment
- View widget [analytics](http://chirpy.dev/docs/features/analytics)
- More to come!

Please note: you may lose your data if there're some hard conflicts during our database migration, but that should be rare.

## End

Please feel free to try our services! We're working hard to add more features to make it easier to use, stay tuned! You can also check our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy) for roadmaps or discussions. Of course,contributions are welcome! ðŸ™Œ
