# Open source

We're so excited to announce that Chirpy has been open-sourced now. ðŸš€

Chirpy is a privacy-friendly and customizable [Disqus](https://disqus.com) alternate. With Chirpy you can access your audience quickly and build a better community.

## Motivation

You may wonder why build a Disqus alternate in 2021, well, here are our answers:

[Disqus shared the personal data of tens of millions of users without them or the websites knowing about it](https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777) ðŸ˜¡.

And [Disqus facing $3M fine in Norway for tracking users without consent](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/disqus-facing-3m-fine-in-norway-for-tracking-users-without-consent/)

Disqus also encumbers your website's performance: [Disqus makes 76 HTTP Requests per load](https://supunkavinda.blog/disqus) ðŸ˜±.

 And you can find a ton of [privacy](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=disqus+privacy&oq=disqus+privacy) and [performance](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=disqus+performance) related issues of Disqus if you google it.

## Solution

To avoid privacy issues as Disqus has, we chose our tech stacks carefully, and we prefer to use self-hosted versions of other services that we don't implement ourselves. e.g., for analytics, we self-hosted a [plausible](https://plausible.io/) instance to avoid sharing your and your customer's data with third-party companies. Plausible is an [open-source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) and [privacy-friendly](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) software as well, so you don't need a cookie consent banner because of using our services. We also plan to provide a self-host solution if you have privacy concerns or just want to keep the data on your server.

For performance issues, we built our services with modern frontend technologies, e.g. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we generated comment pages during the build process, thus your user will see the UI immediately instead of loading a bunch of JS & CSS and API calls to render the UI, it can be very slow on mobile devices.

## Current state

Currently, we're in the public beta phase, which means basic features should be working, like social sign-in, creating a project, integrating it in your website, commenting, and replying with rich-text-formating & markdown shortcuts, like a comment, etc. Please note: you may lose your data if there're some hard conflicts we can't migrate our database easily, but that should be rare.

## End

We're working hard to add more features to make it easier to use, stay tuned! You can also check our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy) for roadmaps or discussions. You're welcome to contribute to this project. ðŸ™Œ
