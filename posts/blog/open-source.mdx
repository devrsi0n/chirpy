# Open source

We're so excited to announce that Chirpy has been open-sourced now. 🚀

## TL;DR

Chirpy is a **privacy-friendly** and **customizable** [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) alternate. With Chirpy, you can reach your audience quickly and build a better community. Check out [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy) to learn how it works.

## Motivation

You may wonder why building a Disqus alternate in 2021. Well, here are the answers:

[Disqus shared the personal data of tens of millions of users without them or the websites knowing about it.](https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777) 😡

And [Disqus facing $3M fine in Norway for tracking users without consent](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/disqus-facing-3m-fine-in-norway-for-tracking-users-without-consent/)

Disqus also encumbers your website's **performance**: [Disqus makes 76 HTTP Requests per load.](https://supunkavinda.blog/disqus) 😱

You can find a ton of [privacy](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=disqus+privacy&oq=disqus+privacy) and [performance](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=disqus+performance) related issues of Disqus if you google it.

## Solution

### Privacy

To avoid such privacy issues, we chose our business model with privacy-friendly in mind. Unlike Disqus, we may not provide a free plan to you, but that makes sure we won't track everyone, sell user data or show Ads to keep the project development going.

We also chose our tech stacks carefully, and we prefer to use self-hosted versions of third-party services. For example, for analytics, we self-hosted a [plausible](https://plausible.io/) instance to avoid sharing your and your customer's data with third-party companies. Plausible is an [open-source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) and [privacy-friendly](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) software as well, so you don't need a cookie consent banner when using our services.

### Performance

For performance issues, we built our services with modern frontend technologies, e.g. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). We generate comment pages during the build process, so your users will see the UI immediately instead of loading a bunch of JavaScript & CSS and API calls to render the UI. The performance boost is even more noticeable on slow mobile devices.

## Current state

Currently, we're in the public beta phase, so basic features should work:

- Social login
- Create a new project
- Integrate into your existing website
- Comment with rich text formatting and markdown shortcuts
- Like a comment
- More to come!

Please note: you may lose your data if there're some hard conflicts during migrating our database, but that should be rare.

## End

Please feel free to try our services! We're working hard to add more features to make it easier to use, stay tuned! You can also check our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy) for roadmaps or discussions. You're welcome to contribute to this project. 🙌
