# Open source

We're so excited to announce that Chirpy is a open source project now. ðŸš€

Chirpy is a privacy friendly and customizable Disqus alternate. With Chirpy you can access your audience quickly and build a better community.

We're working hard to add more features to make it easily to use. You can check our GitHub repo for issues or discussion. Please feel free to contribute!
