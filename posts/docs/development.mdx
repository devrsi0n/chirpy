# Development

You're welcome to contribute to this project.

Chirpy is built upon Next.js and [Hasura](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine). To run this project locally, you'll need to install the following:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- nodejs 14+ & npm@6

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy.git
```

## Start the data server

Hasura is used as the data server. To start the data server, run the following command:

```bash
cd <project-root>/services/hasura
docker-compose up -d
```

### Setup the database and schema

Make sure you're using a seperate termial (e.g. `iTerm2`) not a VSCode terminal, because there're some environment variables will cause some issues.

Install [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html) and run the following command:

```bash
cd <project-root>/services/hasura
# Setup the postgres database schema
hasura migrate apply --up all
# Setup the default enum values
hasura seed apply
# Setup the graphql schema
hasura metadata apply
```

## Setup the frontend

Startup a Next.js app with the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
