# System maintenance

We show a fixed banner to our widgets and pages during a system maintenance, we try our best to keep the downtime as short as possible, but sometimes it is necessary to perform maintenance on the system to improve the performance and unblock new features.

## What you can't do in maintenance mode

You can't post a new comment, delete a comment (as the site owner) or like a comment.

You can't create a new project, delete a project or customize the widget theme.

You can't make comment widget work on your new pages.

## What you can do in maintenance mode

You can still read the comments, you existing session should be unaffected, so you can still see your projects, themes or analytics.

You can also read the docs and blogs.

Thank you for your support!
