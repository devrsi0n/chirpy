# Moderate

Although Chirpy supports [anti toxic comment](/docs/features/anti-toxic-comment), as a moderator (or site owner), sometime we may have improper comments on our site. Chirpy lets you moderate them.

## Delete unwanted comments

Login to your moderator or owner account and go to your comments page. Then, click the **Delete** button next to the comment you want to delete.

User will only see a link on that comment after deleted.

## Deleted note

For site users, if your comment is deleted, you must be violated the rules on that site. You can contact the moderator for reasons.
