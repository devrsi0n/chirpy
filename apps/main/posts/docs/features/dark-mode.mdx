# Dark mode

Chirpy supports dark mode out of box, you can control the dark mode of a widget as your needs.

## Usage

Add a `data-chirpy-theme` property to the rendering element.

```html
<div data-chirpy-comment="true" data-chirpy-theme="system"></div>
```

If you don't know where to put this code, please go through the [Get started](/docs/get-started) first.

## Options

There're 3 options you can control:

- "light"
- "dark"
- "system" (Auto detect the operating system's theme setting)

## Dynamic control

You can change the theme by setting a new `data-chirpy-theme` value, Chirpy will detect the change and update the UI immediately.

```html
<!-- Initial rendering -->
<div data-chirpy-comment="true" data-chirpy-theme="system"></div>

<!-- Change it later according to 
your user's action on your site -->
<div data-chirpy-comment="true" data-chirpy-theme="dark"></div>
```

## Playground

You can try it on our [playground](/play), change the mode selector in the bottom.
