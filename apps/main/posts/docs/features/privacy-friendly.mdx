# Privacy friendly

We believe privacy is a critical right to everyone on the internet, thus we build Chirpy from scratch with privacy in mind.

## What's does privacy-friendly mean?

We don't ask anything from you that would be considered as a privacy threat. Here are some typical privacy concerned scenarios we consider:

### Anonymous login

We provide anonymous login first option for everyone, you only need a `username` to get started. You can connect an email later, and we'll never spam you.

Note: we save your anonymous session in your browser, you may lost the access to your important data (e.g. projects, comments) if you clean your browser cache. You can always add an email or connect a social media account to your account, then you can login with your email or social media account later.

### Social login

We ask the minimal possible information from the social login providers (e.g. Twitter, GitHub), all extra information returned by them is immediately dropped and not stored in any form.

### Analytics

For our internal and widget analytics, we hosted a [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics) instance which is a privacy-friendly and open source tool like Chirpy ðŸ¥³. Along with plausible, we never collect sensitive information like `phone number`, `ip address`. We never sell or share your data with any third-party companies or show Ads on your websites.
