# Self-hosted

You can run Chirpy on your server, it's exactly the same product as our Cloud solution, but you have to install, host and manage your own infrastructure while the Cloud version we manage everything for your ease and convenience.

Chirpy is built upon [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). We'll polish this doc once we have a Vercel template.
