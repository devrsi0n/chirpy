  <h3>Usage on any website</h3>

To embed the comment widget on your website, first add the script tag with your project id to the HTML:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://chirpy.dev/bootstrap/comment.js"
  data-chirpy-domain="<your-domain>"
></script>
```

Then, add the data-chirpy-comment attribute to any HTML element that should render the widget:

```html
<div data-chirpy-comment="true"></div>
```
